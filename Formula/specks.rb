      Specks agents have been installed to:
        #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/specks/agents/

      Claude Code skills have been installed to:
        #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/specks/skills/

      To use /specks-plan and /specks-execute in your projects, run:
        specks setup claude

      This will copy the skills to your project's .claude/skills/ directory.
      You can also run this during `specks init` for new projects.
