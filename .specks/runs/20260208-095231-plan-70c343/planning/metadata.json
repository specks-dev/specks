Problems: (1) References non-existent '--step' flag for 'specks beads sync' on lines 174 and 354, (2) Doesn't capture bead IDs from sync output - passes null to committer, (3) Needs to sync once at session start not per-step, (4) Needs to extract bead IDs from speck file after sync (format: **Bead:** `specks-xxx.N`), (5) Store step→bead_id mapping in session metadata, (6) Pass correct bead_id to committer-agent.
