Issues identified: (1) committer-agent.md references non-existent 'specks beads close' command - should use 'bd close' instead; (2) implementer/SKILL.md references non-existent '--step' flag for 'specks beads sync' and non-existent 'specks beads close' command; (3) Bead ID flow is broken - implementer doesn't capture bead IDs from sync output and passes null to committer; (4) Need to update documentation to match actual CLI commands.",
