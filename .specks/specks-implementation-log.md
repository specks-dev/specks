Entries are sorted newest-first.

## [specks-1.md] Step 0: Project Bootstrap | COMPLETE | 2026-02-03

**Completed:** 2026-02-03

**References Reviewed:**
- [D01] Rust/clap - Build specks CLI as Rust application using clap with derive macros
- [D02] .specks directory - All specks-related files live in `.specks/` directory
- #scope - CLI infrastructure with clap-based command parsing
- #new-crates - `specks` (CLI binary) and `specks-core` (core library)

**Implementation Progress:**

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Create `Cargo.toml` workspace manifest | Done |
| Create `crates/specks/` CLI crate with minimal main.rs | Done |
| Create `crates/specks-core/` library crate with lib.rs | Done |
| Add dependencies: clap, serde, toml, thiserror, anyhow | Done |
| Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for basic CI | Done |
| Add `.gitignore` for Rust projects | Done |

**Files Created:**
- `Cargo.toml` - Workspace manifest with two member crates
- `crates/specks/Cargo.toml` - CLI crate manifest
- `crates/specks/src/main.rs` - CLI entry point with clap command structure (init, validate, list, status stubs)
- `crates/specks-core/Cargo.toml` - Core library manifest
- `crates/specks-core/src/lib.rs` - Library entry point with module declarations
- `crates/specks-core/src/error.rs` - SpecksError enum with thiserror
- `crates/specks-core/src/config.rs` - Config and SpecksConfig structs
- `crates/specks-core/src/types.rs` - Core types: Speck, SpeckMetadata, Step, Substep, Checkpoint
- `crates/specks-core/src/parser.rs` - Parser stub (to be implemented in Step 1)
- `crates/specks-core/src/validator.rs` - Validator stub with ValidationResult, ValidationIssue, Severity
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI workflow with build, test, format, and clippy jobs
- `.gitignore` - Rust project ignores

**Files Modified:**
- None (all new files)

**Test Results:**
- `cargo build`: Completed successfully in 5.84s
- `cargo test`: 1 test passed (verify_cli)

**Checkpoints Verified:**
- `cargo build` completes without errors: PASS
- `cargo test` passes (empty test suite OK): PASS
- `./target/debug/specks --version` prints version: PASS (outputs `specks 0.1.0`)

**Key Decisions/Notes:**
- Used Rust 2024 edition and rust-version 1.85 for latest features
- Created stub modules for parser and validator to allow lib.rs to compile; actual implementation in Steps 1-2
- CLI includes all four subcommands (init, validate, list, status) with stub implementations
- Added clap CLI verification test to ensure command structure is valid
